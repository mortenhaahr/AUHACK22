# Pitch
- Currently there are 1 billion lonely nerds in the world who lack the social skills it requires to find a partner.
- They immediately get banned from traditional dating services for being "creepy" or sending "inappropriate pictures".
- We have built a safehaven for them that we call PokéDating.
- With PokéDating finding the love of your life has never been easier. Like any good Pokémon trainer you start by assembling your dream team of Pokémons.
- We then built a highly accurate statistical model based on bleeding edge AI to help perfectly match two trainers together.
- Based on your PokeProfile we find the trainers you're the most interested in meeting and help you catch them.

- We plan on monetizing the app through more powerful Pokéballs and loot boxes.
- Through lootboxes you can unlock extra rare Pokémons to your team, and match exclusively with other trainers with the same skill-level as you.
- This way you don't have to waste your time swiping on the cringe noobs who aren't as based as you.

- Our product appeals primarily to the Asian market where we see an overrepresentation of weebs.
- However, as we saw with Pokémon Go, Pokémons have a special place in peoples heart and can help unite the world.
- In 2022 we estimate a market share of 3 % of the online dating market.
- By 2023, when we go viral, this increases to 93.15 %.
- In 2024, once we make our exit after being sued by Nintendo, we expect a profit of 3.14 trillion USD.
- So the only question left to ask is: Will you join our journey and help us catch 'em all?
